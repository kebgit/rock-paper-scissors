    <h1>Rock Paper Scissors, heck yeah!</h1>
    <h3>Must play in the console with inspect element, and type play(). It's best of 5</h3>

<!-- 
PLAN

Make list of options
create play() function
Have computer pick one at random and assign it to computer pick variable
player picks one of the options by typing out rock paper or scissors into prompt
logic with if statements (3 for each human choice, nested with 3 each for each computer choice)
console log who won, reset all values
wait for play() to be called again
